# Analyzing Suicide Cluster Using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning
# Overview
This project analyzes suicide clusters using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning to identify patterns and risk factors. By examining demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic data, it uncovers insights into suicide trends and predicts high-risk clusters for targeted interventions.
Features

Dataset: Global or regional suicide rate datasets with demographic and socioeconomic variables.
EDA: Visualizations of trends, correlations, and distributions using statistical methods.
Machine Learning: Classification/regression models to predict suicide clusters or risk levels.
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices visualized for model performance.

# Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
Pandas/NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization of EDA insights and model results.
GeoPandas: Optional for geographic data analysis.

# Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/suicide-cluster-analysis.git


Install dependencies:pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn geopandas


Run the main script:python suicide_cluster_analysis.py



# Usage

Execute suicide_cluster_analysis.py to perform EDA, train models, and visualize results.
The script loads a dataset, conducts EDA, trains machine learning models, and generates plots for insights and performance.
Customize dataset paths or model hyperparameters (e.g., feature selection, model type) in the script for experimentation.

# Project Timeline

Duration: February 2024 â€“ April 2024
Developed to support mental health research and intervention planning through data-driven insights.

# Results

EDA reveals key risk factors (e.g., age, income, region) correlated with suicide clusters.
Machine learning models accurately predict high-risk areas, with visualizations highlighting performance metrics.
